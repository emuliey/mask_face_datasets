# mask_face_datasets
datasets for mask face recognition
Since deep learning models usually require large-scale datasets for training, the lack of mask face datasets will make it difficult for the model to learn the feature mapping between whether the face is occluded by the mask, resulting in poor recognition rate. For this problem, this paper use a mask face image synthesis algorithm based on key point detection to generate the corresponding dataset, and generates a more realistic mask face image for model training through face detection, key point detection and mask coverage.

here are our datasets for training and testing:
